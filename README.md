uniClip is like a chat app but for your devices. You can quickly send messages, small files, links from one device to another with ease via uniClip!

## Why uniClip?

uniClip solves a problem which I encounter very often, a problem which you might face too:

- ### The problem
> If you have multiple devices and want to quickly share texts(links), small files between them, your current options include:
> 1. using Bluetooth [con: too slow],
> 2. using USB [cons: cables (btw good luck sharing messages/links)]
> 3. using a file sharing app [cons: shady, space consuming, full of adverts, frustrating cross-platform support]
> 4. using Nearby Share or AirDrop [cons: limited to short range connections, platform specific]
> 5. using Google Drive, DropBox etc.[cons : very difficult to manage over long term, too much effort just for sharing small files, links, etc],

- ### The solution
> uniClip! although not perfect (issues discussed later) but you do get some benefits upon using uniClip:
> 1. a familiar chatbox/chatroom like interface
> 2. faster than Bluetooth speeds (speed depends on your internet connection)
> 3. cross-platform support (it's an web app)
> 4. requires just a browser, so no extra space consumption
> 5. free and open-source, forever

Along with these benefits you also get other features like device specific storages ('myDevice') and global storages ('allDevices')  
> now with notes@uniClip

## notes@uniClip {#notes}
notes@uniClip is an addon to the uniClip webapp which allows you to take notes in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) format *(which is super cool... I think)*. All your notes are globally accessible to all your devices. Yup, that's it! Try it yourself.


## Issues {#issues}
> <font color='crimson'> Major issue: Desktop version of this app is not yet available, it's just a scaled up version of the mobile app </font>

> Other issues:
>> - You can't forward messages
>> - You can't edit media (crop/clip) before sending
>> - You can't directly share files from other apps to uniClip
>> - You can't rename/delete devices.
>> - Uses internet connection for sharing files, so using uniClip for sharing large files is not recommended

## Future Plans {#fPlans}

> - ability to take notes(added!)
> - change various settings
> - customizable themes
